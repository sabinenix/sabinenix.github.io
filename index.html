                Hi! I'm sabine and this is my website! This is temporary. I'm still figuring out what should be on here!

                I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Earth and Environmental Science. I am interested in studying large scale ecology and environmental change. This past semester, I realized I love working with spatial data, so I am now working on an independent research project using remote sensing to study land cover change in Madre de Dios, Peru. I am really excited to keep learning how to use remote sensing techniques to study the environment!

                This past summer, I got my first chance to do field work with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Southwest Biological Station in Moab, Utah. Over the 7 weeks I worked for USGS, I was able to help out with many different projects, including the multi-year "Extreme Drought in Grassland Experiment" (EDGE), a project studying strategies to restore ecosystem services in areas degraded by cattle grazing through soil stabilization and native plant restoration, and a project looking at the ability of biological soil crusts to withstand wind and water erosion.

                This semester, I am studying abroad at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland. While I am here, I am working remotely with the US Forest Service on a project using archival records to better understand the current patterns of street tree diversity in Philadelphia.
